It will need [NCuboid][] to work. Nothing else to say, self-explanatory ! Basically, it would use the Cuboids for the game itself, and you would define a "game zone" with one selection, automagically subdivised in 4 cuboids with every needed flags etc. You would be able to start a game with a command, players would use a command to join, teams would have colored leather armors, and why not fireworks of the winning team color at the end ?

_TODO List:_
* Everything
