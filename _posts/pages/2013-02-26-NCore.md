### *Status :* Indev - 50%

Core plugin, it's like a platform for every nodes to connect, for each one to be able to use each other, without cycle dependencies.

_TODO List:_
* Plugin will be modified as nodes are modified
* Not that much work here. Will be finished after all plugin are finished, at least all plugins interactions
