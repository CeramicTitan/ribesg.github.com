NCore is a [Bukkit][] plugin and is part of the [NPlugins][] project.
You can view the source of all plugins in the [NPlugins Github repository][].

### *Status :* Private Alpha

Core plugin, it's like a platform for every nodes to connect, for each one to be able to use each other, without cycle dependencies.
Nothing more to say here. You may have to use this plugin if you want to have interactions between plugins that are designed to have interactions.
For example, you could use [NCuboid][] with [NPlayer][] to be able to use Cuboid Jails in [NPlayer][].
