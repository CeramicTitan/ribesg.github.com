The N plugin suite is a pack of [Bukkit][] plugins designed to work with each other. They are as compatible as possible with mods. None of this plugin is released yet !

* **[NCore][]** : Status : Indev - 50%

    Core plugin, it's like a platform for every nodes to connect, for each one to be able to use each other, without cycle dependencies.

* **[NGeneral][]** : Status : Indev - 0%

    General plugin, with everything like **`/time`**, **`/weather`**, **`/rocket`**, **`/god`**...

* **[NCuboid][]** : Status : Indev - 80%

    Important plugin, basically like Worldguard, but with every functionnality I need. It's also something much more difficult to do, learning learning learning !

* **[NPunisher][]** : _(Will be renamed to **NPlayer**)_ Status : Indev - 0%

    It was supposed to be a **`/ban`**, **`/mute`**, **`/kick`**, **`/jail`** plugin, it will be a little more than that. For example there will be an **`/info`** command which would give you informations about the player (first/last seen, punishment status (ex: is he banned ?), and his IP for moderators / admins).

* **NChat** : Status : Indev - 90%

    Will allow modification of chat format, colors in chat, bad words check, private messages with 1 player or 1 group (channel-like)

* **[NDodgeball][]** : Status : Indev - 0%

    It will need [NCuboid][] to work. Nothing else to say, self-explanatory ! Basically, it would use the Cuboids for the game itself, and you would define a "game zone" with one selection, automagically subdivised in 4 cuboids with every needed flags etc. You would be able to start a game with a command, players would use a command to join, teams would have colored leather armors, and why not fireworks of the winning team color at the end ?

* **NEnd** : Status : Not started

    A rewrite of my [TheEndAgain][] plugin

* **NEgg** : Status : Not started

    A rewrite of my [MagicEgg][] plugin

This list will grow as ideas come.
