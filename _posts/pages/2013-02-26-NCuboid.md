NCuboid is a [Bukkit][] plugin and is part of the [NPlugins][] project.
You can view the source of all plugins in the [NPlugins Github repository][].

### *Status :* Indev - 80%

Important plugin, basically like Worldguard, but with every functionnality I need. It's also something much more difficult to do.

_TODO List:_
* Almost every commands
* Investigate non-Cuboid regions (Cylinders)
