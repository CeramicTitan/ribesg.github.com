NPlayer is a [Bukkit][] plugin and is part of the [NPlugins][] project.
You can view the source of all plugins in the [NPlugins Github repository][].

### *Status :* Indev

It was supposed to be a **`/ban`**, **`/mute`**, **`/kick`**, **`/jail`** plugin, it will be a little more than that. For example there will be an **`/info`** command which would give you informations about the player (first/last seen, punishment status (ex: is he banned ?), and his IP for moderators / admins).
