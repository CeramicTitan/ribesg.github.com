### *Status :* Private Pre-Alpha

Important plugin, basically like Worldguard, but with every functionnality I need. It's also something much more difficult to do.

_DONE:_
* Plugin Structure
* Cuboid, CuboidDB representations. Almost completely done.
* Almost every Events are handled, linked to config etc.
* Cuboid creation commands

_TODO:_
* Almost every commands: changing flags, resize, shift, allow/deny players/groups, all flag-attributes related commands
* Investigate non-Cuboid regions (Cylinders)
